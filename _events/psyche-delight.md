How are you? Feeling anxious, hopeful, ecstatic? A mix of everything? If you were the hero of a painting what would it look like? Let's have fun exploring our mental health by creating images. Give your bits and bobs an opportunity to shine!

This Together Workshop will focus on performance and wellbeing through a playful approach suitable to all ages, abilities and languages. 
Whether you're English or not, when it comes to feelings, words are often hard to find. Creating tableaux is a fun and poetic way to illustrate and share our experiences. So let's dig into our wardrobes and our recycle bin, add lights and music to it and have fun venting this bloody year out!

This workshop will be led by Sophie Besse, Theatre director and art therapist, founder of PSYCHEdelight Theatre Company of Sanctuary.  PSYCHEdelight runs the Together workshops in various contexts nationally and internationally to celebrate diversity and help social inclusion.
