Max has just been sectioned and she doesn’t know why. She’s completely healthy, or so she thinks. But how does she know what’s healthy and how can she tell what’s real? Meanwhile, someone’s drawn Eamon Holmes on the blackboard, Damon Albarn’s faked his own death, and the only thing that’s on the TV is “A Question of Sport.”

Written by Michael Hajiantonis about his time in an NHS psychiatric ward, Going Slightly Mad is an honest and unflinching account of the mental health services in the United Kingdom: Both humorous and uncompromising in equal measure.


> "a palpable insight into the reality of institutionalism in the UK" ***** _The Student_

> "the comedic element really added a level of humanity and nuance that you wouldn't normally get in depictions of psychiatric wards" \*\*\*\* _Edinburgh University Television_

> "sharp and very funny" \*\*\*\* _FreshAir_

In 2019 Going Slightly Mad went on a UK tour ending with a run at the Edinburgh Fringe. For Sightlines Big Mind presents a recording of the touring show filmed in August at Bedlam Theatre. It will be followed by a Q and A with writer/director Michael Hajiantonis and lead Lizzie Lewis.
