A bold yet humorous piece, Can I Touch Your Hair? explores identity, what cultural appropriation really means and personal hair struggles but more importantly, the pride learnt along the way. How do you navigate everyone's unnecessary questions and comments about your hair?

Lekhani grew up mixed race in Cumbria and she’s realised she doesn’t actually know what to do about her hair. No one taught her and YouTube just isn’t helping. 99p Alberto Balsam won’t do.

Thank goodness for her hairdresser, who is in fact her longest standing relationship to date and ohh does she love getting her hair done.

Trying out new hairstyles is all well and good but how do you cope with everyone's unnecessary questions and comments?

_The performance will be followed by a question and answer session with with Lekhani Chirwa_
