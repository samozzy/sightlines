    bio: |
      Born in Ireland to parents of Nigerian and Guyanese descent has given me a beautiful yet complex insight into my diverse world and defined my identity.

      My journey of self-awareness is heavily reflected in my poetry. I love scribbling my thoughts on paper and bringing those words alive as spoken word.

      Performing at many spoken word nights in the North West has allowed me to connect with people from different walks of life. In February 2020, my work was published alongside 30 other writers in a Change the Word Anthology.

      Now published, I would love nothing more than to further my career as a poet and have my own collection one day.
