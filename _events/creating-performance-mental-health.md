> _To explore specific aspects of the conversation around performance and wellbeing, Sightlines 2021 will bring together performance makers and facilitators for a series of panel discussions on topics significant to the artists involved. Each will include structured discussion between the panelists, with time for the audience to ask questions._ 

**Making Performance from Mental Health Experiences** - _Hosted by Lily Asch, trained counsellor, mental health advocate and founder of Real Talk: Storytelling for Mental Health_ 

Many of the performers and facilitators involved in Sightlines have chosen to create artistic work based on their own personal mental health experiences. Such performances can offer the opportunity to increase awareness of mental illness, reduce stigma and offer an insight to the audience. Creating autobiographical work, especially about difficult periods in oneâ€™s life, can be rewarding but also poses challenges. This conversation will allow some of our artists to share and compare their processes of making such performances, and how to do so in a safe and enriching way.
