Gender is a social construct that can absolutely suck. Tonight, we are going to clown with these rigid structures and take the piss out of what oppresses us. Join TriniDad & TooGayThough as he hosts the zoom drag king night to end all zoom drag king nights. Featuring some of the best kings on the circuit, performing just for you! 

Some say it's a zoom gig but we'd like to call it, your own personal drag night. Our incredible line up includes Loose Willis (of Pecs), Romeo De La Cruz (Man-Up Finalist and Ambassador for BOiBOX), Clay Taurus (Man-Up 2020 Finalist), Len Blanco (as seen on the BBC) and Beau Jangles (of the Family Jewels Drag). Let's get sweaty and sexy.
