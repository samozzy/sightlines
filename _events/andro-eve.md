This online workshop will provide a space for those questioning or wanting to explore their own gender. Andro and Eve’s Artistic Director Finn Warman will facilitate this creative and playful session. 

Using conversations and creative exercises, this workshop will help participants reflect upon and be inspired by different ways to express gender in their own lives, rather than on stage. It is intended as a space for self-reflection and connection for people of marginalised and diverse genders.* 

*We use the term ‘marginalised’ to describe anyone who feels that their gender expression or identity means they may face discrimination in society today. 

We understand that those wishing to attend may not yet have found a label that helps describe / identify their gender, or that they may not wish to use labels at all.
