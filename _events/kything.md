Join us for an intimate evening where we will have a listening party of the first episode of Kything, a podcast dedicated to making the everyday stories of mental health visible. This will be followed by a fishbowl conversation from past Real Talk speakers about the power of storytelling and wellbeing more widely, and finally end with a breakout discussion between audience members to encourage connection and conversation.

Each Kything episode features a 10 minute mental health story told by a past Real Talk participant followed by an interview with them.

This podcast is presented by [Real Talk](https://www.realtalkproject.org/), a social enterprise dedicated to mental health storytelling. It was made possible by the generous sponsorship of [UnLtd](http://www.unltd.org.uk/).
