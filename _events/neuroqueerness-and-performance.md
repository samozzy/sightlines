A discussion on the intersection of neurodivergence and queerness and its exploration and significance in performance practice, with neurodivergent LGBTQ+ panellists from different art forms, led by Sammy Glover.

Sammy runs a workshop looking at a number of strategies and schools of thought in all these areas, building towards more competent and safe rehearsal rooms for participants, directors and facilitators alike.
