No experience necessary! Learn to beatbox, jam with other young musicians, improve your vocal techniques and make your own music using nothing but your mouths - from Hip Hop and Grime to R&B and Dubstep. 

Led by hip hop artist Conrad Murray and other Beats & Elements members. We will play games, do vocal techniques, and share beatboxing and songwriting skills that we use to create hip hop theatre. 

We will talk about our process, the fundamental sounds and different ways to put material together.
