Award winning theatre company LUNG explore the different techniques of verbatim theatre and the responsibility that comes with making socially engaged work. Led by co-artistic directors Matt Woodhead and Helen Monks, Verbatim Bootcamp will examine how to manage the wellbeing of the people you’re working with, your creative team and yourselves when making socially engaged, documentary theatre.

How do you turn the things that people have said into theatre? What are the responsibilities that come with making socially engaged work? How do you manage the wellbeing of the people you’re working with, your creative team and yourselves?

In Verbatim bootcamp co-artistic directors of the theatre company LUNG, Matt Woodhead and Helen Monks, will explore the answers to these questions in their own practice, and the broader world of Verbatim theatre. Founded in Barnsley in 2012, LUNG is a campaign led verbatim theatre company that tours work nationally. LUNG works closely with different communities to make verbatim theatre and hidden voices heard.
