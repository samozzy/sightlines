This panel will explore how trauma and racial identity intersect with artistic practice, within institutions, individuals’ identities and in communities. 

How can we have nuance in how Global Majority stories are told? 

How can artists be cared for and empowered in the process?

Led by Nicole Joseph, we will explore these and other themes that emerged during BPH’s Empowered Black & Global Majority Programme. 

Nicole Joseph is a Writer, Theatre Maker & Community Artist based in Bradford. She is Creative Instigator at Bradford Producing Hub and has led on their Empowered programmes for Black & Global Majority, LGBTQIA+ and their upcoming Deaf, Disabled & Neurodiverse programme for artists. She has led on the Empowered: Series of Care programme for artists covering: preventing burnout, sustainability, knowing your worth & rights and in partnership with Mind The Gap: inclusive practice, building creative accessible spaces and access riders. She project-managed their recent Make The Change event holding space for discussion around what changes we want to see in the industry for marginalised artists and allies and showcasing and celebrating the artists in BPH’s Empowered cohorts. As a Writer and Theatre-Maker Nicole has a holistic, spiritual, human centred and community-care focussed practice. She was awarded in the most recent round of Arts Council England's Developing Your Creative Practice funding to progress her playwriting practice.
