The scaffolding of everyday life and routines disintegrated in a flash last year, and with it much of our social identity. 

Who are we now? What must we become?

 

These strange times present unexpected opportunities to shed layers, grieve and re-emerge changed.

In this workshop we will use tools from the Theatre of the Oppressed to create a collective Chrysalis: an immersive space in which to metabolise and transform our collective experiences of mental & emotional wellbeing in times of uncertainty & emergence. This praxis uses embodied narrative to support individuals & communities to realise their creative potential for liberation.

 

Reboot the Roots is a charity that promotes social inclusion through the arts. It uses theatre and other creative tools to support people marginalised from full, happy and active participation in society.

Come fly with us.
