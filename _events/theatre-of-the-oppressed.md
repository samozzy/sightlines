What is the Theatre of the Oppressed?


A conversation with Dr. Birgit Fritz, transcultural activist, drama therapist, writer, Feldenkrais practitioner and lector for transcultural theatre work.
 

Birgit is a long-time practitioner of the Theatre of the Oppressed, a world-wide movement to humanise humanity through emancipatory theatre. This series of games and techniques was greatest by legendary theatre activist Augusto Boal in Brazil in the 1950s and went on to become a world-wide movement supporting social and political change. The emphasis of this process is the empowerment of individuals and communities to transform their present reality, effectively a rehearsal for the revolution.
 

Hanu and Birgit will discuss the healing effects of emancipatory theatre-making on individuals and communities, the novel challenges of using these techniques in the global north, and the beauty of giving up being busy.
