_To explore specific aspects of the conversation around performance and wellbeing, Sightlines 2021 will bring together performance makers and facilitators for a series of panel discussions on topics significant to the artists involved. Each will include structured discussion between the panelists, with time for the audience to ask questions._ 

**Navigating White Spaces** - _Hosted by Emily Aboud, Artistic Director of Lagahoo Productions - specializing in feminist and queer work from the Caribbean and beyond_ 

This is a conversation that will take much more than one hour and 15 minutes, but we will take this opportunity to start the discussion around what it is like to navigate arts institutions in the UK as people of colour. 

How does one market a show about the BIPOC experience if you are in the minority in that theatre building? How does one navigate creative meetings as the minority on the team? What does the future of the industry look like and what practices can we implement to make it better? The panel consists of industry professionals from multiple arts backgrounds, onstage and off. 

This panel will be BSL interpreted.
