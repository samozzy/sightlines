### **WELCOME. HAVE YOU GOT A CUP OF HOT WATER READY? COME AND SAVOUR THE SPICES IN THE AIR. LET US SNIP FRESH MINT INTO YOUR TEAâ€¦**

_Change the Word: Around the Table_ is a fun and moving reflection on the stories which make us and how we meet each other through words.

Combining poetry from new writers from across Barnsley, Coventry and Sheffield, from 12 countries across the world, _Change the Word: Around the Table_ celebrates the power of bringing the voices of our community together even when we are physically apart.

In January 2021 Change the Word gathered a fresh cohort of participants. New to each other, new to poetry, they have created this writing through workshops and mentoring from the Good Chance team. _Change the Word: Around the Table_ takes you on a journey through kitchens, countries and dreams, as we sit together around the dinner table.

Recorded in their own homes, these new performers read extracts of poetry, share recipes and create music. Together, we exchange sweet treats and poems. Together, we imagine what welcome looks like.

With your Zoom link you will also be emailed the illustrated script to read along with and look back at.

_Change the Word: Around the Table_ is brought to you by Change the Word participants from Albania, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ethiopia, El Salvador, Iran, Kurdistan, Malaysia, Sudan, Turkey, UK and Zimbabwe.

Kindly supported by the Coronavirus Community Support Fund, distributed by The National Lottery Community Fund.

This is the third iteration of our Change the Word community poetry project (and the first fully online!). We bring together refugees, asylum seekers and locals to connect through a shared love of writing.
