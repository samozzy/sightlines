Join us to celebrate the end of our festival with a closing night cabaret of music and other performances!

P﻿erformances by:

**Wolf Peaches** (they/them) is the solo project of Hazel Thompson, setting emotive, original melodies within a swoony harmonic landscape; fusing pop and folk sounds with a teaspoon of soul. Politically fuelled reflective songs, floating in dream scapes and grounded in a deep respect for flora. Resisting any single genre, each song inhabits its own world; yet all are linked by the same confident lyricism and singular, fluid vocal. They recently toured Slovenia with Hannah James and the Etno Histeria World Orchestra, as well as performing at Floating Castle Festival. They are one half of the duo Lucy & Hazel, performing original, politically fuelled songs that are equal parts love, rage and humour. They are a facilitator with Key of She and a member of The Emmergene Collective.

**Diyo Bopengo** (he/him) is a Congolese from the DRC who grew up in South Africa and lives in the UK. He volunteers with Volunteer Action Sheffield and other humanitarian organisations. He is part of Good Chance Theatre’s poetry collective Change the Word and has co-published two of their anthologies

**Sarah Orola** (she/her) was born in Ireland to parents of Nigerian and Guyanese descent, which has given her a beautiful yet complex insight into her diverse world and defined her identity. Her journey of self-awareness is heavily reflected in her poetry. She loves scribbling her thoughts on paper and bringing those words alive as spoken word. Performing at many spoken word nights in the North West has allowed her to connect with people from different walks of life. In February 2020, her work was published alongside 30 other writers in a Change the Word Anthology. 

**Michael Haj** (he/him) started DJing whilst studying in Edinburgh. In that time, he founded club night Pleasuredome, known for its anarchic mix of art, visuals, and uplifting music, as well as presented a show on local radio station EH-FM. An eclectic collector of all kinds of groovy, soulful and uplifting tunes, regularly playing vinyl only set at Orbit Taproom. He is also a theatre-maker and his play Going Slightly Mad was shown as part of Sightlines 2021.
