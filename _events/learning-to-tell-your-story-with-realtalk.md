Join us for an interactive workshop showcasing practical exercises and ideas for crafting a story. You will be invited to develop an idea that is alive within you around mental health or wellbeing and have space to share at the end.

This hands-on workshop is run by Real Talk, a social enterprise dedicated to mental health storytelling. We’ve worked with so many humans from so many different backgrounds over the years and supported them in learning to create a 10 minute, oral story. 

Expect creative writing exercises, learning about story frameworks and other little tips for making a compelling and effective story. Our work focuses on mental health and wellbeing so participants will be invited to explore these themes within themselves too. 

The session will end with a small sharing circle, where you will have space to share the seeds of the story so far. We’re also launching our podcast, Kything, during the festival. Join us there to get a taste of the kind of story you might create.
