In this workshop with Lauren Steele, performer and choreographer for OFFIE Award winning troupe Pecs Drag Kings, we’ll explore how to best care for our health & wellbeing while developing and performing creative work. 

Creative work is so often seen as passion projects that we should therefore have endless physical and emotional energy for, but no work should entail a lack of personal boundaries around wellbeing, no matter how much you love it. Together, we’ll unpack how best to understand, meet and communicate about our own needs.
