It's been a time. It'd be nice to just get on with it wouldn't it. Start up again. Carry on. Get back to normal. But all of that is Over There. And we're here. So we'll have to start with that.   
  
Ceremonial mess-about of the present moment, featuring a fabulous line-up of comedians, and hosted by high priestess of the divinely ridiculous, Lucy Hopkins. Settle in. This one's for real.
