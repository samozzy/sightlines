> _To explore specific aspects of the conversation around performance and wellbeing, Sightlines 2021 will bring together performance makers and facilitators for a series of panel discussions on topics significant to the artists involved. Each will include structured discussion between the panelists, with time for the audience to ask questions._ 

**Neurodiversity and Performance** - _Hosted by Heather Johnson actor and creative/access facilitator and mentor with Access All Areas Theatre Company_ 

This discussion will bring together neurodiverse directors and performers from different backgrounds to discuss the intersection of their experiences with their work in the arts. How their neurodiversity might impact their relationship with performance and the stories they choose to tell. And the ways in which rehearsal rooms, arts institutions and performance spaces can be made more or less accessible. 

This panel will be BSL interpreted.
