As part of the Sightlines x BPH Online Performance and Wellbeing Festival this October, we are offering the opportunity for a small group to participate in two online workshops and then an online performance, exploring the art of storytelling for mental wellbeing.

These hands-on workshops will support you in learning to create a 10 minute, oral story.
 Expect creative writing exercises, learning about story frameworks and advice for making a compelling and effective story. Then on the Saturday there will be the chance to perform your story to an audience on Zoom.

This is open to anyone (aged 18+) interested in learning the craft of storytelling and using it to write and perform their own mental health story. It will involve two 2.5hr Zoom workshops (evenings of the 10th and 12th October) and a performance on Zoom (daytime 14th October).


It will be led by Lily Asch, a storyteller and mental health advocate. Lily completed a storytelling apprentice at the Scottish Storytelling Centre, has a Post Graduate Certificate in Counselling Skills, and has been running workshops on Storytelling for Mental Wellbeing since 2016.
