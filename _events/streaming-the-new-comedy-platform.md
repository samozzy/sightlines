Bilal Zafar and Ken Cheng are both stand-up comedians who have found a performance platform on Twitch since the start of lockdown. They will be their usual funny selves whilst showing some of their favourite moments, talking about how the platform has benefited them as performers and how it has created a sense of connection for them and their audiences.  
  
Discussing things like whether Twitch has had them reconsider how they can be in control of their own material and working hours and secure a steady income. The ways Twitch creates a community feel with its supportive set up - including live chat streams and "raiding". And what the future of the platform is for them and for audiences after the lockdown.

Bilal Zafar was nominated for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Fringe 2016 and won the Hackney Empire New Act Award (NATYS) in the same year. He has taken 3 solo shows to Edinburgh and toured them around the UK including runs at Londonâ€™s Soho Theatre. Zafar also began streaming on Twitch last year and has amassed a large and dedicated following. He currently streams an improvised, interactive comedy show _Hot Peppsy Football manager_ in which he plays an unhinged English football manager, _The Acting School of excellence_ - a live version of his web series and _Writing The Coder_ in which he writes a feature film script with the help of his audience.
