Join us to hear about the experiences of chronically ill theatre-makers. We will explore questions around the challenges of creating theatre whilst living with chronic illness and of working in an overstretched, often inaccessible theatre industry; as well as the benefits of creative expression for wellbeing and the value of connecting with other disabled artists. The panel will be made up of theatre-makers previously on The Bank, Sheffield Theatre's supported artist scheme, and led by Katrina Woolley. 

Katrina Woolley (she/her) is a chronically ill theatre-maker and producer and director of Sightlines Festival. She is the founder of Big Mind Theatre, has worked with companies including Utopia Theatre and MAYA Productions, and was previously a supported artist at Sheffield Theatres, where she ran a creative affinity space for other chronically ill theatre-makers. She also works as a Support Worker and Youth Engagement Officer for mental health charity, Young Minds.
