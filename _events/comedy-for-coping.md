This is an introductory session to a new 6 week comedy course specifically aimed at people with mental health difficulties. It introduces stand-up comedy as a real-world method of developing confidence, communication and connection with other people, to combat loneliness whilst literally providing a platform for participants to stand up for themselves. The course has been designed by award-winning comedian, number 1 best selling author and mental health campaigner Dave Chawner. Using his own experience of mental illness Dave sensitively introduces comedy to change the tone around the topic and inspire people with positivity that recovery can be fun.
