How do we as directors, practitioners and artists create rehearsal rooms and creative spaces that are free to take creative risks but remain safe? Isn’t it a contradiction to have a ‘safe’ space that also dares? What are boundaries and what is consent? How do we handle conflict responsibly and productively in a room?
