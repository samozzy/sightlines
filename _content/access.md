# Access

The Sightlines team wants to create a space where everyone can come together to celebrate and discuss the relationship between performance, theatre, and wellbeing without restrictions. As a festival focused on wellbeing accessibility is crucial. We’re collaborating with companies who make accessibility their mission and aspire to do the same. We welcome all feedback on how we could make our events even more accessible and will do all we can to help you access any of our events - so please let us know if there is anything you think we can do to improve, or any individual needs we can help with.  

We have taken the following steps to promote accessibility for our festival and its various shows, panels, and workshops:

* Live Captioning and BSL translations will be available whenever possible
* Detailed content warnings are available for all events.
* Audio descriptions will be available whenever possible
* Our core team members have undergone Mental Health First-Aid Training.

The access details for each event will be on the event pages once the programme is launched. If you have any questions, suggestions, or comments, don’t hesitate to contact our team: <info@sightlinesfestival.co.uk>.

Many of our events are **captioned**, and/or offered with a **British Sign Language Interpreter**. These are signified by the icons: {% include icon-demo.html %}.

## Events Guides

* We encourage you to get ready for our events five minutes early, to allow time to get settled and make sure you don’t miss anything!
* Please make sure that the space that you’re watching the event is suitable - if it’s a movement workshop then you may need space to move around, if it’s a discussion on some more mature topics, then you may want to use headphones
* Some events may happen live, but then also be available for the whole festival. We encourage you to attend live to get the most out of the event and join the conversation

## Zoom Guides

* You will be able to check the type of event you’re booking on the programme page, and this will let you know whether you’ll be able to be seen and/or heard
* If you’d rather not be seen or heard on a Zoom event, you can turn your camera and microphone off using the icons in the lower left corner of your screen
* You can tell if a Zoom event is being recorded as there will be a red icon in the top left corner of your screen
* We encourage you to add your pronouns to your name on Zoom for interactive sessions, and would ask you to use everyone else's

## Chat Guides

* Some events will have the option to interact using live chat, to either ask questions or talk to other audience members
* While we encourage discussion, we ask that you respect other people on the chat
* These chats will be moderated and any comments that are deemed to be classed as bullying, offensive or discriminatory will be removed

## Comfort online 

Pronouns: at some events you may be invited to actively participate but you will never be required to have your video or mic on unless this has been explicitly stated in the event description (i.e. for participatory workshops)

If cost is a prohibitive factor to your festival attendance, please email us - we can offer further concessions and free tickets. You can get in touch via the [contact page](/contact/) or <support@sightlinesfestival.co.uk>.
