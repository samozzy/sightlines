# Access

The Sightlines team wants to create a space where everyone can come together to celebrate and discuss the relationship between performance, theatre, and wellbeing without restrictions. As a festival focused on wellbeing accessibility is crucial. We’re collaborating with companies who make accessibility their mission and aspire to do the same. We welcome all feedback on how we could make our events even more accessible and will do all we can to help you access any of our events - so please let us know if there is anything you think we can do to improve, or any individual needs we can help with.  

Making our events accessible is very important to us, and we are collaborating with companies who make accessibility their mission.

## What have we done to make our events accessible? 

* Automated closed captioning will be available for nearly all events
* Some our talks and panels will have a live BSL interpreter 
* Some pre-recorded events will be subtitled 
* Our core team members have undergone Mental Health First-Aid Training

## Where can I find the Access Details for each event? 

You can find all the events on the [‘Events’](/events/) page. Then, to find the Access Details for a specific event, you can click on it to read the full details.  

Many of our events are **captioned**, and/or offered with a **British Sign Language Interpreter**. These are signified by the icons: {% include icon-demo.html %}.

If you have any questions before you arrive at an event, you can email us at <info@sightlinesfestival.co.uk>.

## Watching events on Zoom 

All our events are shown online, through [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

If you have a question during the event, you can use the Zoom Chat function at the bottom of the screen, and our team will be there to help you. 


## Will I be seen or heard during a Zoom event? 

Some events may invite you to turn your device’s video camera and microphone on. This might be for a workshop, so that you can participate. 

You always have the choice to turn your device’s video camera and microphone off. You can do this using the icons in the bottom left corner of your screen.

## Using the Zoom Chat 

Some events will invite you to interact using the Zoom Chat function. 

This might be to ask the audience a question, or to invite you to talk to other audience members. 

We encourage positive discussion. Any comments that are bullying, offensive or discriminatory will be removed by our Zoom Chat moderators. 

## Will Zoom events be recorded?
 
* Some of our events will be recorded so other audience members can watch them later. 
* If an event is going to be recorded, this will always be announced before the event begins. 
* You can tell if a Zoom event is being recorded as there will be a red circle in the top left corner of your screen.
