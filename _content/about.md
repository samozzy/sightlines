# Sightlines Festival

Sightlines performance and wellbeing festival is a two week online festival. created to explore the conversation surrounding the relationship between performance and wellbeing, inspired by the thoughts and experiences of the many artists involved. Our first edition will take place 13th-25th of July 2021, with varied events including performances, workshops focused on the subject of mental health and wellbeing in its many forms. As well as investigating the process of creating performance, how positive wellbeing can be promoted through different art forms and for performers, participants, producers and audiences. 

This past year questions around wellbeing in the performing arts have come to the forefront as many artists had their work put on hold. We have had time to reflect, structural issues have become more clear than ever, new wellbeing issues have arisen and new forms of performance and performance outreach have developed

Space will be made for discussion around specific aspect of the process and how this intersects with personal identity, experience and societal issues.

# About Big Mind Theatre 

Big Mind Theatre exists to explore the relationship between performance and personal and societal well-being. Established in 2017 by Katrina Woolley, our focus on mental health and well-being is holistic. It extends throughout our production processes to support our performers and production team members, and to impact our audiences.
 
Big Mind’s past productions include _Going Slightly Mad_, an unflinching autobiographical play about the mental health services in the United Kingdom. The show’s national tour and run at the Edinburgh Fringe took place from July to August of 2019. Our first foray into digital theatre was a production of Vaclav Havel’s absurdist classic _The Garden Party_ which streamed live in July of 2020. The company’s first production, _Mind-Full_ (2017), was a piece of verbatim theatre created by company founder Katrina Woolley on the topic of student mental health.
 
Big Mind’s work expands beyond the stage - from creating the “Anxiety-Free Fringe Guide” with the Edinburgh Fringe Society in 2018-19 to leading numerous “Mindfulness for Performers” workshops, we endeavour to expand the company’s reach and develop our unique directorial practices.

## Praise for past performances 

> “It’s live, properly live, and I love it […] this is a bright spot in a world of dark theatres.”
Bouquets and Brickbats
 
> “rare double achievement of not only tackling taboos surrounding sectioning in this country, but doing so with a warm-hearted vigour that ultimately treated its characters with kindness.”
The Rattlecap
 
> “Using theatre within university as a medium to remove stigma, initiate conversation, and change perception is a thing to be celebrated.”
The Student

### _The Garden Party_

Big Mind’s most recent performance was the company’s first foray into digital theatre, this Czech absurdist classic commentated on the hindrances and absurdities of online communication. It was also an experiment into how well-being in the lockdown could be supported by providing an opportunity for performers and theatre-lovers to experience a live show through pandemic-induced restraints. Bouquets and Brickbats writes, “It’s live, properly live, and I love it […] this is a bright spot in a world of dark theatres.”
 
### _Going Slightly Mad_
“A palpable insight into the reality of institutionalism in the UK” – The Student. Written by Michael Hajiantonis about his time in an NHS psychiatric ward, Going Slightly Mad is an honest and unflinching account of the mental health services in the United Kingdom. The production completed a National Tour and a run at the Edinburgh Fringe from July - August 2020. The Rattlecap called it a “rare double achievement of not only tackling taboos surrounding sectioning in this country, but doing so with a warm-hearted vigour that ultimately treated its characters with kindness.” A full recording of Going Slightly Mad will be livestreamed as part of the Sightlines Festival.
 
### _Mind-Full_
Big Mind’s first performance, “Mind-Full,” was a piece of verbatim theatre. A review from The Student reflected, “Using theatre within university as a medium to remove stigma, initiate conversation, and change perception is a thing to be celebrated.” The show was compiled by company founder and director Katrina Woolley who recorded and shared student experiences with mental health. Mind-Full launched Big Mind’s ethos to centre mental health and well-being within its shows and projects.
